Hi My name is Yash Mangal, I'm a python beginner. I recently came accross **Advent of code** on my Twitter and decided to solve these problems and see how much I've learnt.

Do not expect these solutions to be upto the mark and there are definetly many and much better solutions out there. This is an attempt to practice my Git skills as well as test out my Python skills.

Since I'm late anyway. I'm gonna be beginning from the 2015 Event.
